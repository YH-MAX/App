#  SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation  
### Empowering Communities Through Smart Water Monitoring

---

##  Project Overview

The app acts as an **early-warning and data-collection tool** that contributes to improving water quality.  
It empowers individuals or community groups to monitor local water bodies (rivers, lakes, streams) in real time.  
Users can detect sudden drops in quality, which may indicate a pollution event.  
The app can log this data with a timestamp and (optionally) a GPS location, creating a record that can be reported to local authorities or environmental organizations.  

This directly supports the **“reducing pollution”** and **“minimizing release of hazardous chemicals”** targets under **SDG 6.3**.

---

##  Goal

The goal is to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
