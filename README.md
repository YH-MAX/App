  SDGS 6: Clean Water And Sanitation
  Empowering Communities Through Smart Water Monitoring 

The app is to act as an early-warning and data-collection tool that contributes to improving water quality. ​It empowers individuals or community groups to monitor local water bodies (rivers, lakes, streams) in real-time. ​Users can detect sudden drops in quality, which may indicate a pollution event. ​The app can log this data with a timestamp and (if you add the feature) a GPS location, creating a record that can be reported to local authorities or environmental groups. ​This directly addresses the "reducing pollution" and "minimizing release of hazardous chemicals" parts of the target. 

The goal is to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally.
